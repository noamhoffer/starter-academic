I'm an assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Bar-Ilan University, Israel. My research focuses on Kant and early modern philosophy with further interests in metaphysics, political philosophy, philosophy of religion, and aesthetics. 
I earned my Ph.D. in Philosophy at Indiana University under the direction of Allen Wood.
