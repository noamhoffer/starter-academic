abstract: 'In the “Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic” of the Critique of Pure 
Reason, Kant contends that the idea of God has a positive regulative role in the 
systematization of empirical knowledge. But why is this regulative role assigned to 
this specific idea? Kant’s account is rather opaque, and this question has also not 
received much attention in the literature. In this article, I argue that an adequate 
understanding of the regulative role of the idea of God depends on the specific 
metaphysical content Kant attributes to it in the Critique and other writings. I 
show that neither a heuristic principle of conceptual systematicity, nor conceiving 
God as a hypothesis of an intelligent designer, can satisfy the demands of reason 
to make the unity and necessity of the laws of nature intelligible. Regarding the 
positive account about the metaphysical content of the idea of God, I support 
my argument by referring to Kant’s pre-critical discussion of the usefulness of the 
conception of God for the project of science, and by expounding Kant’s critical 
account of the necessity of the laws of nature. Thus, my account sheds light on the 
continuity of Kant’s conception of God and his appropriation of his own rationalistic metaphysics.'
