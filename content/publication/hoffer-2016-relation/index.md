abstract: 'Andrew Chignell and Omri Boehm have recently argued that Kant’s
pre-Critical proof for the existence of God entails a Spinozistic conception
of God and hence substance monism. The basis for this reading is the
assumption common in the literature that God grounds possibilities by
exemplifying them. In this article I take issue with this assumption
and argue for an alternative Leibnizian reading, according to which
possibilities are grounded in essences united in God’s mind (later also
described as Platonic ideas intuited by God). I show that this view about
the distinction between God’s cognition of essences as the ground of
possibility and the actual world is not only explicitly stated by Kant, but is
also consistent with his metaphysical picture of teleology in nature and
causality during the pre-Critical period. Finally, I suggest that the
distinction between the conceptual order of essences embodied in the idea
of God and the order of the objects of experience plays a role in the
transition into the Critical system, where it is transformed into the
distinction between the intelligible and the sensible worlds.'
